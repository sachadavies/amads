"""
The `pitch_list_transformations` module
provides basic functions for transforming pitch lists
(e.g., transposition, inversion, retrograde, rotation).

This small module provides some more niche routines
that are specific to tone rows in serial music.

) -> list:
    """
    Implements a set of hexachord rotations of the kind described in krenek 1960, p.212.
    Splits the row into two hexachords and iteratively rotates each.
    This function returns a list of lists with each iteration until
    the cycle is complete and come full circle.


    Parameters
    ----------
    row
        A tone row, or any sequence of 12 integers.
    transpose_iterations
        If True, transpose each iteration to start on the original pitch of the hexachord.
        This alternative is also described by krenek.
        Note this often converts a 12-tone row into one with repeated pitches.

    Returns
    -------
    list
        A list of lists with the full cycle.

    --------
    >>> row_krenek = [5, 7, 9, 10, 1, 3, 11, 0, 2, 4, 6, 8]
