# Partitura seems to have a rounding error, reporting measure length
# of 1919 instead of 1920 when divs per quarter is 480. This can lead
# to measures with fractional duration (e.g. 3.997916666666667) and
# the insertion of ties across measure boundaries that are in the
# wrong place. When DIV_TO_QUARTER_ROUNDING is not None, measure
# durations are rounded to the nearest 1/DIV_TO_QUARTER_ROUNDING of
# a quarter note. Do not round to whole beats because there might
# be a fractional measure with a pickup note. 24 allows for 32nd
# notes and 64th-note triplets (1/24 beat). Rounding must be enabled
# also by passing rnd=True to div_to_quarter(). The intent is to
# round measure boundaries but not note start/duration (because note
# times can be from a MIDI performance, where time is not quantized,
# at least not to symbolic durations or beats.)
#
DIV_TO_QUARTER_ROUNDING = 96

# plan: multiple passes over iter_all()
# for each part: add the part to a Concurrence
#      1st pass: get staff numbers from notes, extract measures, get div/qtr
#           create a Concurrence of staves if more than one,
#           create measures in each staff
#      2nd pass: get notes, rests, insert parameters into lists
#      3rd pass: re-tie notes that cross measures in case the measure boundary
#           has moved due to rounding
#      4th pass: build Note and Rest objects, insert into Measures
