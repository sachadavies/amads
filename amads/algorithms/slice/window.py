"""Sliding window algorithm.

The algorithm segments a musical score into fixed-size windows that can optionally
overlap. Each window contains all notes that are sounding within its time boundaries.

    size : float
        The size of the window in time units
    align : str
        How to align the window relative to the reference time:

        - "center": reference time is at window center

    Parameters
    ----------
    passage : Score or Iterable[Note]
        The musical passage to be windowed
    size : float
        The size of each window (time units)
    step : float, default=1.0
        The step size to take between windows (time units).
        For example, if step is 0.1, then a given slice will start 0.1 time units
        after the previous slice started. Note that if step is smaller than size,
        successive windows will overlap
    align : str, default="right"
        Each generated window has a `time` property that points to a
        particular timepoint in the musical passage. The `align` parameter determines
        how the window is aligned to this timepoint:
        - "left": the window starts at ``window.time``
        - "center": ``window.time`` corresponds to the midpoint of the window
        - "right": the window finishes at ``window.time``
    start : float, default=0.0
        The desired time of the first window
    end : float, optional
        If set, the windowing will stop once the end time is reached.
        Following the behaviour of Python's built-in range function,
        ``end`` is not treated inclusively, i.e. the last window will
        not include ``end``
    times : Iterable[float], optional
        Optional iterable of times to generate windows for. If provided,
        `start` and `end` are ignored
