    Returns the distribution of note durations in a Score.

    Each duration is assigned to one of 9 bins.
    The default centers of the bins are on a logarithmic scale as follows:
        component    bin center (in units of quarters)
        0            1/4 (sixteenth)
        1            sqrt(2)/4
        2            1/2 (eighth)
        3            sqrt(2)/2
        4            1 (quarter)
        5            sqrt(2)
        6            2 (half)
        7            2*sqrt(2)
        8            4 (whole)
    Durations below sqrt(2)/8 quarters (just above a sixteenth triplet) and
    greater than sqrt(2) * 4 quarters (about 5.65685 beats) are ignored.

    If `bin_centers` is provided, the centers of the bins are set to the
    values in `bin_centers` and rounding is done on a log scale, i.e. the
    boundary between x1 and x2 (bin centers) is sqrt(x1 * x2). Any duration
    below the lower boundary is assigned to the first bin, and any duration
    above the upper boundary is assigned to the last bin.

    Args:
        score (Score): The musical score to analyze.
        name (str): A name for the distribution and plot title.
        bin_centers (Union[list[float], None]): bin centers (optional)

    Returns:
        Distribution: containing and describing the distribution of note durations.
