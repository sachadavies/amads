        path_to_score:
            Path to the score in any supported format (e.g., MusicXML).
            Deduce any necessary onsets, beats etc. from the score as calculated by Partitura.
            Warning: Partitura takes "beats" from time signatures denominators, e.g., 6/8 has 6 "beats" (not 2).

        Keith records per-note syncopation values with
        0 if start and end on beat,

        3 if start and end off,

        In this implementation, user provided data (see parameters) takes precedence.
        To use user-provided data, we require onsets and one of ends or durations.
        If no user data provided, seek a score on the class.

        Parameters
        ----------
        onset_beats:
            User supplied data for the onset time of each note expressed in beats. Optional.

        The weighted note-to-beat distance measure (WNBD)
        measures the distance between note starts and
        records the traversing of beats, and the distance to the nearest beat.

        The authors clarify that "notes are supposed to end where the next note starts",
        so we're working with the inter-note interval (INI), rather than the duration.
        Note that there are one fewer INI values than notes.

        Among the limitations is the incomplete definition of "beat" and the agnostic view of metre:
        "By strong beats we just mean pulses." (§3.4).
